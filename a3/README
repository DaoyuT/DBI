		where (p_retailprice > 931.01) AND (p_retailprice < 931.3);
		
	3. 	select sum (s_acctbal + (s_acctbal * 1.05)) 
		from supplier;
		
	4. 	select sum (ps_supplycost) 
		from supplier, partsupp 
		where s_suppkey = ps_suppkey;
		
	5. 	select distinct ps_suppkey 
		from partsupp 
		where ps_supplycost < 100.11;
